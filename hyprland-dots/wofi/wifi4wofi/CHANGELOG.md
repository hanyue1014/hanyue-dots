## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.1] - 2022-10-27
- Added a splash window/network scanning window alert, as one of the issues with wofi-wifi-menu has been it doesn't appear for a few seconds. The wait is due to scanning for networks. I felt it was best to show the user that something was happening. 

## [0.5.0] - 2022-10-24
### Added
- Forked project from wofi-wifi-menu and fixed the problem of the wifi passwords being overwritten
